Our society combines the findings in neuroscience with the power of computation. To really harness the latter, practice is paramount. This repo serves as OxNeurotech's computational training ground.

## Programming Platforms

To get used to solving problems with programming, here are some coding platforms:
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com)  
Challenges on Codewars appeal to both beginners and experts, along with everyone else in between. The challenges are ranked from 8 kyu (easiest) to 1 kyu (so so difficult). Once you're confident, maybe you'd be interested in doing more than just problems, who knows? Codewars helps with this by allowing you to write and maintain your very own challenges, and translating existing problems into different programming languages. It is completely free to access all parts of the platform.   

- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)  
A very popular platform that software companies sometimes use as part of their interview process. It comes with well-structured progressions for a multitude of specialisations. It also includes software engineering interview prep along with practice timed tests.  

- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com)  
Probably the industry standard for where to pick interview questions from, Leetcode would be your best bet for a complete warehouse for what to practise on. It also offers Mock Assessments like HackerRank, but many other features require you to pay a subscription fee, including quite a few of the important problems that you may want to practise on.

- [ROSALIND](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)  
This is a Bioinformatics coding platform which contextualises the Python programming to the Biological applications we may be more interested in. Completely free, but not as stacked as the other options in terms of number of challenges available.
